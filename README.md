# Blendle frontend assignment - Reddits best

Hello fellow coder!

At Blendle we make single page applications that are not only beautiful to look at but are also easy to use and well written.

An application functions very differently from a website. It requires state to be kept in the browser while the user makes complex interactions.

Our designers have designed a little reddit like application. It shows a list of top stories and you can dive into the details.

We don't want to take too much of you time, we think it’s doable to complete this challenge in 4 or 5 hours. Please try to stick to this timeframe and let us know if you'd like more time.

## Technical requirements

- Single page application (SPA)
- Written in React
- Use proper build tools for build automation and testing
- Add 3 working tests
- Deployed on Netlify (If you haven't heard of it, it's a very nice and easy service to deploy sites, we use it for most of our applications as well)

## Functional requirements

- List the 10 best posts on Reddit using their [public api info](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#GET_best) The api is public, no auth needed: [data](https://www.reddit.com/best.json)
- Clicking on **the name of the subreddit** gives you details about the subreddit inside the application (see design)
- Clicking on **the title of a post** opens it on reddit.com (e.g. like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/a0x9ga/hello/)

## Design

- Look closely at the design we've provided.
- You can open the file using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Just create an account (this is free) and drag provided .fig file into your browser.
- The font we used is called '[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)' (also free) (FYI: Inter used to be called 'Inter UI', but was later renamed to Inter.)
- We've included the icon as well, so you don't have to export it

## Can I / Do I / Should I … ?

- Are tools like Create React App allowed?

  Sure, it's perfectly fine to bootstrap your project with something like Create React App or similar.

- What browsers do I need to support?

  Your solution should work in the latest version of Chrome. We'll also use Chrome to test mobile version using the Device Toolbar in the developer tools.

- How will we be testing the solution?

  We will open and test the application that you have deployed on Netlify. Next to that we will review the code itself: is the code clean, what does the architecture look like, are the test cases clear etc.

- Should I use animations?

  The application should feel smooth and polished. In some cases that may require a minor fade in/fade out animation. Try to see what animations you think are nice, without overdoing it.

- How do I deliver the assignment?

  - Email us the link of where the application is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
  - Email us a zip file with the source code
